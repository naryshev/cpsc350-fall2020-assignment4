Comments:
We stumbled into a lot of errors that hindered us from making steady progress on this assignment. Currently the extent of our functionality is reading a map file and outputting it, and generating a map file based on height/width and population density. We were close to implementing successive generations for the randomly generated board but kept running into segmentation faults.
